    ## Testing

    ## Bugs
    ## Deployment

    I had a minor issue whilst deploying via Github pages as originally my html files were in a folder in the root filesystem. Once I deployed to Github pages, I was only able to view the README.md. To rectify this I simply moved my html files to the root folder of the project.  

    I used StackOverflow to resolve my minor **[issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48919200/github-pages-only-showing-readme-file)
